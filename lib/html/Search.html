<h1 align=center>Searching in exmh</h1>
<p>
There are several ways to search for things in exmh: 

<h2>In the current message. </h2>
<p>
Search for a string in the current message body. Searching uses regular
expression syntax, and case is ignored. Note that this only looks in
the currently displayed message. (Use the "Search" field in Pick to
search through all messages in a folder. ) 

<h2>In the scan listing</h2>
<p>
Search for a string in the table of contents. Searching uses regular
expression syntax, and case is ignored. This just searches over what
you can see in the display. If you select All, then all matching messages
are selected. 

<h2>In the current folder</h2>
The MH pick program is used to search within a folder. This can run
slowly because each message in the folder must be processed. 
<p>
The pick dialog displays some command buttons, two fields, and a menu
that says "Choose pick option". 
<p>
Ignore the fields labeled "Add to Sequence" and "Pick from Seq/msg"
unless you are already familiar with pick. 
<p>
Choose your selection criteria with the menu, which offers: 
<ul>
<li>subject 
<li>from 
<li>to 
<li>cc 
<li>before - select messages received before this date or time. 
<li>after - select messages received after this date or time. 
<li>search - search the contents of all messages for a string. 
<li>component - enter a mail header name, like X-URL, and a value to
search for in that header. 
</ul>
<br>

If you choose more than one option, the messages must match all of
them, unless you use the Not and Or buttons to build up more complex
criteria. 
<br>


<br>

The "Add to Sequence(s)" option will add the matching messages to
an MH sequence. Just pick a meaningful name for the sequence. (Sequences
are not supported well by exmh, yet.) 
<p>
The "Pick from Seq/msg(s)" lets you narrow the search to a sequence
(e.g., "unseen" or something you defined yourself) or a set of messages
(e.g., last:100 for the last 100 messages in the folder). 
<br>


<br>

The "Add to Sel" option determines if the matching messages are added
to the currently selected set, or if a new set is created. 

<h2>In all folders</h2>
<p>
A full text search over all folders uses the <strong>Glimpse</strong>
facility. 
<p>
First you must create an index, which costs about %10 to %15 space
overhead based on the size of your message storage. You can index the
current folder or all folders. The indexing runs in the background
but it may take some time. 
<p>
The search can be over all folders, the current folder, or the current
folder and all of its nested folders. A search over multiple folders
can be stopped, although the Stop happens at the end of a folder. 
<p>
The search tolerates spelling errors, and you can control this with
the Opts... menu. 
<p>
The results of the search are displayed, and you can click on the message
IDs and exmh will visit that message. 

<h3>Maintaining your Glimpse Indexes. </h3>
<p>
The exmh interface does not automatically maintain your Glimpse Indexes.
The typical scenario is that you periodically index your mail, either
by choosing Index as you leave for the day, or with a nightly "cron
job". Your job can send a Tcl command to Exmh and have it do all the
hard work. You may have trouble connecting to exmh, but you can try
something like: 
<p>
<br>

In your crontab, for 1:30 AM 
<pre>30 1 * * * /tilde/welch/scripts/glimpseindex -display unix:0</pre>
<p>
<br>

In the script, using a hack to allow /bin/sh to run the script: 
<p>
<br>

#!/import/tcl/bin/wish4.0.g 
<br>

# The next line is a comment in Tcl, but not to /bin/sh \ 
<br>

exec /import/tcl/bin/wish4.0.g -f "$0" ${1+"$@"} 
<br>


<br>

message .msg -text "Starting Glimpse Index" 
<br>

pack .msg 
<br>

if [catch {send exmh Glimpse_Index} err] { 
<br>

catch {exec cat &gt; /dev/console &lt;&lt; $err} 
<br>

} 
<br>

exit 
<p>
<br>

If you want to write your own script, use something like this: 
<p>
<br>

#!/bin/csh -f 
<br>

cat /dev/null &gt; ~/Mail/glimpseindex.log 
<br>

foreach f (`cat ~/Mail/.folders`) 
<br>

glimpseindex -H /tilde/welch/Mail/.glimpse/$f ~/Mail/$f | \ 
<br>

egrep '(Indexing|Size)' &gt;&gt; ~/Mail/glimpseindex.log 
<br>

end
