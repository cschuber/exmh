    <h1>Delivery Status Notifications</h1>
    <p>Basically, Delivery Status Notifications (DSNs) define a special MIME type
      to report message status information.  The types of information that
      are transmitted are successful delivery, delayed delivery, or failure,
      with possibly additional diagnostic information. A DSN is <em>not</em>
      able to report if a user has actually looked at a message, or any other
      status beyond "it was placed in their mailbox".
    <h1>Message Delivery Notifications</h1>
    <p>Message Delivery Notifications (MDNs) build on the DSN framework to report
      the final disposition (seen, discarded, etc) once it has been placed in a user's
      mailbox.  There are some caveats here:
    <ul>
      <li>Receipt of a "read" MDN does <em>not</em> imply that the message was understood
	or dealt with - merely that it was displayed for the user to read.  The user
	may have been asleep, on the phone, or just didn't want to act on your mail.</li>
      <li>Not all mail programs support MDNs.  If the recipient's software doesn't support it,
	you won't get one back.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>EXMH Support</h1>
    <p> EXMH is able to display both DSNs and MDNs without further configuration.
      Some additional configuration is required to make full use of the support.
    <p>DSN options are located on the 'Preferences - Simple Editor' panel, and
      are also settable on a per-message basis via the 'DSN...' menu in Sedit.
      Note that for DSN support to work, you <em>must</em> have a version of
      MH that supports it (which requires some patching).
    <p>A patch is available <A HREF="http://black-ice.cc.vt.edu/~valdis/mh-dsn.patch">here</A>
    <p>The EXMH MDN support is able to display a MDN without further configuration.
      However, to ask for a MDN on a given message, you need to select 'Ask for Receipt'
      in the Sedit 'More...' menu.  In addition, you must put the address to send the MDN
      to in the 'Preferences - MIME' panel, in the 'Disposition Notification To:' field.
      This should probably be set to the same address as your From: field, unless
      you've read <A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2298.txt"> RFC2298</a>
      and fully understand the implications.
    <p>The 'Send MDNs' button in the 'Preferences - MIME' panel controls when
      to send an MDN.  By default, MDNs are not sent.  A reasonable value is
      'Auto/Ask', which will automatically send an MDN unless a condition is
      detected prompting a check with the user (such as an MDN directed to a mailing list,
      or not back to the message sender, etc).
    <p>
    <h2>The nitty gritty technical stuff</h2>
    <p>DSNs and MDNs are defined in the following IETF RFCs:
    <UL>
      <LI> <A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1891.txt">RFC1891 - SMTP Service Extension for Delivery Status Notifications</A>  </LI>
      <li> <A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1892.txt">RFC1892 - The Multipart/Report Content Type for the Reporting of Mail System Administrative Messages</A>  </li>
      <li> <A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1893.txt">RFC1893 - Enhanced Mail System Status Codes</A>  </li>
      <li> <A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1894.txt">RFC1894 - An Extensible Message Format for Delivery Status Notifications</A>  </li>
       <li> <A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2298.txt">RFC2298 - An Extensible Message Format for Message Disposition Notifications</A>  </li>
    </UL>
