<h1 align=center>Aliases Help</h1>
<p>
Aliases are short names for email addresses. You can have multiple
address as part of one alias. Aliases can refer to other aliases that
are defined <em>after</em> them. 
<p>
The email address can include rfc822 comments in parenthesis, like:
(Brent Welch) welch@acm.org
<p>
BUG WARNING: the addresses are not really parsed, and if you have a
comma inside a comment, it screws up. Don't use this browser in that
case. 
<p>
Use Import to import aliases from .mailrc files. 
<p>
Search lists by typing in the entry below them. Hit space when the
correct alias is selected. (Use &lt;control-space&gt; when the correct
address is selected. That'll work for alias completion, too.) &lt;space&gt;

<p>
will define a new alias if what you have typed does not match an existing
alias. &lt;control-c&gt; 
<p>
will delete the matching alias. 
<p>
You can select and paste out of the Alias list. The selection is not
exported from the Address list. This asymmetry means you can select
an address, then select and paste another version of that address into
the entry widget below the address list, and (finally) click Change
to update that address. 
<p>
Your aliases are usually stored in ~/.mh_aliases For the truth, check
your AliasFile: MH profile entry. 
<p>
Exmh remembers the placement of the window, but not necessarily its
size. For best results, play with the following resources. 
<p>
For Tk 3.6 and earlier: 
<br>

*Alias*alias.listbox.geometry: 20x10 
<br>

*Alias*addr.listbox.geometry: 30x10 
<p>
For Tk 4.0 and after: 
<br>

*Alias*alias.listbox.width: 20 
<br>

*Alias*alias.listbox.height: 10 
<br>

*Alias*addr.listbox.width: 30 
<br>

*Alias*addr.listbox.height: 10
