<h1 align=center>Sedit Key Binding Setup</h1>
<p>
Use <button -command Sedit_Pref>this dialog</button> to change the
keybindings for edit functions. 

<h2>Options</h2>
<p>
Type Kills SEL - whether or not typing overwrites the current selection.

<p>
Paste Sets Insert - whether or not &lt;Button-2&gt; to paste also sets
the insert cursor (where stuff will get pasted). 
<p>
Note: The selpaste function is for additional keybindings for paste.

<p>
Scroll Button: The Tk text widgets scroll if you hold down a mouse
button and drag. This setting chooses which button to use. The default
is &lt;Button-2&gt;. In this case, if you drag scroll, there is no
paste operation. 

<h2>Event Syntax</h2>
<ul>
<li>Any sequence like <meta-x> also results in a binding for <escape><x>
<li>Case is significant in the keywords Control, Meta, Shift, Key,
etc. Watch out for BackSpace, with a cap S. 
<li>Multiple bindings: to bind multiple (different) keystrokes to a
function, separate the sequences with spaces. 
</ul>
<p>
The Events Helper lets you discover what events are generated by the
keys on your keyboard.
