<h1 align=center>Binding Dialog</h1>
<p>
Use the binding dialog to change the keybindings for command accelerators.
A binding ties an event to a Tcl command. 

<h2>Event Syntax</h2>
<ul>
<li>Any sequence like &lt;Meta-x&gt; also results in a binding for
&lt;Escape&gt;&lt;x&gt; 
<li>Case is significant in the keywords Control, Meta, Shift, Key,
Back<strong>S</strong>pace, etc. 
<li>Multiple keystrokes can be bound to the same command. Separate
them with a space, e.g.: &lt;BackSpace&gt; &lt;Prior&gt; 
</ul>
<h2>Changing a Binding</h2>
<ul>
<li>Edit the keystrokes for the existing commands in each entry widget.
<li>Press &lt;Return&gt; in the entry and the change takes effect right
away. Or, click the Save button, which makes the dialog go away, too.
<br>


</ul>
<h2>Defining a New Accelerator</h2>
<p>
The Define button and the entries at the top are used for new commands.
For example, to make &lt;Control-z&gt; close the window, enter 
<br>

Command: <code>wm iconify . </code> 
<br>

Key: <code>&lt;Control-z&gt; </code> 
<br>

and then press the Define button. 

<h2>Deleting a Binding</h2>
<p>
Delete bindings by clearing the associated entry and pressing Return.

<p>
Your settings are saved in ~/.exmh/exmhbindings
