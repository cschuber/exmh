<h1 align=center>Customizing the Reply Menu</h1>
<p>
In general, you can define buttons and menus for exmh by means of X
resource specifications in your ~/.exmh-defaults file. Put these resources
at the beginning, before any comment lines about the stuff below being
automatically inserted. 
<p>
If you want a reply button, try this. 
<p>
*Mops.ubuttonlist: repl 
<br>

*Mops.repl.text: Repl 
<br>

*Mops.repl.command: Msg_Reply (<em>your favorite <strong>repl</strong>
arguments here</em>) 
<p>
Note that "repl" was used. The button name "reply" is already taken
by the Reply... menu button. You can also add new entries to the reply
menu. Try this: 
<p>
*Mops.reply.m.uentrylist: sep ack 
<br>

*Mops.reply.m.l_ack: Acknowledge 
<br>

*Mops.reply.m.c_ack: Msg_Reply -cc me -nocc cc -filter /usr/welch/Mail/mhl.ack

<p>
The "uentrylist" resource lists the menu entries defined added by you.
It is meant to be redefined by you. It's default value is: 
<br>

*Mops.reply.m.uentrylist: sep help 
<p>
So, the "help" entry that calls Msg_ReplyHelp will disappear once you
start defining your own reply variations, unless you add "help" to
your uentrylist resource. 
<p>
"sep" is a special menu entry type defined in app-defaults to just
be a menu separator - a thin line. 
<p>
"ack" is the your name for the menu entry, and "l_ack" defines the
label on the menu entry. "c_ack" defines the Tcl command associated
with that entry. Msg_Reply takes the same arguments that the MH repl
command does. You'll have to check out the repl man page for all the
details."
