<h1 align=center>Preferences</h1>
<p>
The Preference settings are divided into a number of subsections. These
correspond to different modules of the Exmh implementation. Use the
buttons in the main Preferences window to select various sections.

<p>
Information about each setting will appear if you click on the short
description of the preference item. 
<p>
There are three types of options you can set through the Preferences
dialog: 
<ol>
<li>Choices are represented by radio-style buttons where only one button
in the set can be enabled at once. These take effect immediately. <li>Booleans
are represented by check-sytle buttons. If the checkbox is dark, then
the option is turned on. This takes effect immediately. 
<li>Numeric and filename settings have entry widgets in which you can
type in a new value. The new value takes effect when you type &lt;Return&gt;,
or when you click "Save". 
</ol>
<h2>How Preferences Take Effect</h2>
<p>
The preference dialogs are tied more directly to exmh than you might
expect. If you toggle a radio or check button, the underlying variable
that controls exmh is changed immediately. The Save button commits
your settings to disk. 
<p>
The Save button will save your settings in an exmh-defaults file in
your ~/.exmh directory. This is an Xresources-style file. 
<p>
The Reset button will restore the settings from defaults and your last
saved preferences file. 
<p>
The Dismiss button leaves the settings as they are displayed and removes
the pref window. Thus, those settings that "take effect immediately"
are still in effect but they are not saved to your pref file.
