<h1>Bugs fixed in exmh since 2.0.3</h1>

<ul>
  <li>You can now have more than one exmh running on the same display
  <li>Fixed MIME formatting in Receipt-Notification message
  <li>Fixed encoding of whitespace in header lines
  <li>Restored 'Invoke menu with right button' message on large messages
  <li>Unseen sequence is no longer trashed after a sort or pack
  <li>Fixed ordering of MIME type guessing; It used to be mailcap,
      mime.types, magic, now it is mime.types, mailcap, magic 
  <li>Fixed mailcap file extension parsing to ignore entries with
      nametemplate=%s
  <li>Fixed problem in X-Image-URL with ~ in pathnames
  <li>Fixed bug in alias editor
  <li>Fixed address-book lookup/expansion to create a new "To:", "cc:"
      or whatever line so wrapping isn't a problem 
  <li>Improved code for posting to newsgroups
  <li>Consistent field width for the count in the Unseen window
  <li>Fixed installation glitch where hitting Verify before Patch would
      raise an error about an undefined variable 
  <li>Added a file create of .mh_sequences to the New Folder code
  <li>Fixed small bug in searching body of message
  <li>Fixed bug with compose in empty drafts folder
  <li>Fixed a minor bug in the regular expression for URLs, so
      <mailto:foo> loses the trailing '>' as it should
  <li>Fixed handling of extra parameters on mailto: URLs
  <li>Don't display message parts if 1) it's a text/*vcard; or 2) it's
      got a "Content-Disposition: Ancillary" header
  <li>Fixed error in regexps in ftoc.tcl where digits followed by a "+"
      would confuse the marking of current message 
  <li>Fixed Help...>Color Legend crash
  <li>Made menubuttons and regular buttons the same size when using
      tkstep 
  <li>Fixed the actions for Rescan, Pack, and the various Sorts not to
      call Msg_ShowSomething afterwards.  This had the unintended
      side-effect of, if no current message was set, setting the current
      message to the first unseen message

      rendered no longer crashes

      folders

  <li>Allow ispell preferences to work before sedit has been opened
  <li>Fixed problems with annotation settings
  <li>References to exmh(background) should have been to exmh(bgPeriod)
      in BackgroundFixup
  <li>Fixed <a HREF="file.html#location"> in HTML browser
