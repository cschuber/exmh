<h1>Bugs fixed in exmh since 2.0.3</h1>

<ul>
  <li>You can now have more than one exmh running on the same display
  <li>Fixed MIME formatting in Receipt-Notification message
  <li>Fixed encoding of whitespace in header lines
  <li>Restored 'Invoke menu with right button' message on large messages
  <li>Unseen sequence is no longer trashed after a <code>sort</code>
      or <code>pack</code> 
  <li>Fixed ordering of MIME type guessing; It used to be
      <code>mailcap</code>, <code>mime.types</code>, magic, now it is
      <code>mime.types</code>, <code>mailcap</code>, magic 
  <li>Fixed <code>mailcap</code> file extension parsing to ignore
      entries with <code>nametemplate=%s</code>
  <li>Fixed problem in <code>X-Image-URL</code> with <code>~</code> in
      pathnames 
  <li>Fixed bug in alias editor
  <li>Fixed address-book lookup/expansion to create a new "To:", "cc:"
      or whatever line so wrapping isn't a problem 
  <li>Improved code for posting to newsgroups
  <li>Consistent field width for the count in the Unseen window
  <li>Fixed installation glitch where hitting Verify before Patch would
      raise an error about an undefined variable 
  <li>Added a file create of .mh_sequences to the New Folder code
  <li>Fixed small bug in searching body of message
  <li>Fixed bug with compose in empty drafts folder
  <li>Fixed a minor bug in the regular expression for URLs, so
      <code>&lt;mailto:foo&gt;</code> loses the trailing '&gt;' as it
      should 
  <li>Fixed handling of extra parameters on <code>mailto:</code> URLs
  <li>Don't display message parts if 1) it's a
      <code>text/*vcard</code>; or 2) it's got a
      <code>Content-Disposition: Ancillary</code> header 
  <li>Fixed error in regexps in <code>ftoc.tcl</code> where digits
      followed by a "<code>+</code>" would confuse the marking of
      current message 
  <li>Fixed Help...>Color Legend crash
  <li>Made menubuttons and regular buttons the same size when using
      tkstep 
  <li>Fixed the actions for Rescan, Pack, and the various Sorts not to
      call <code>Msg_ShowSomething</code> afterwards.  This had the
      unintended side-effect of, if no current message was set,
      setting the current message to the first unseen message

      rendered no longer crashes

      folders

      should have

      <code>exmh(bgPeriod)</code> in <code>BackgroundFixup</code>

      browser 
  <li>Prompt the user before executing the command portion of a button
      tag which is either non-local or in <code>/tmp</code>
</ul>
