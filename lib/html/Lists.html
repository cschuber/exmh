<h1 align=center>Mailing Lists</h1>
<p>
There are three exmh-related mailing lists: 
<dl>
<dt><a href="mailto:exmh-announce@redhat.com">exmh-announce@redhat.com</a>
<dd>This is a moderated list that is used for announcements about new
exmh releases. This gets very little traffic. 
<dt><a href="mailto:exmh-users@redhat.com">exmh-users@redhat.com</a>
<dd>This is an open list used for general question and answer about
exmh. This list also gets any messages sent to exmh-announce, so you'll
hear about new releases on this list, too. There is also a digest version
of this list. 
<dt><a href="mailto:exmh-workers@redhat.com">exmh-workers@redhat.com</a>
<dd>This is an open list meant more for experts that are dabbling with
the internals of exmh.  <i>This list is no longer shared with exmh-users.</i>
You may wish to subscribe to both.
</dl>
<p>
Use the menu operations under Help... Mailing Lists to add or remove
yourself from these lists. If you need more detailed help about administration
of these lists, send mail to exmh-users-request@redhat.com with a message
that just says "help"
