<h1 align=center>Address Database Help</h1>

<p><b>The Address Database is provided to help you automatically track
names and email addresses and to perform lookups of partial names and
addresses.</b>

<h3>Storing data in the Address Database</h3>

<p>You can choose to make the address database self-maintaining or you
can maintain it "by hand".

<p>For a self-maintaining address database, set "Enable Address
Saving" to "on" in the Address Database Preference panel.  As you view
mail messages the "From" address will be automatically extracted and a
corresponding Address Database entry either created or updated.

<p>You may also want to enable automatic deletion of old addresses.
Each address in the database is marked with the date of the last
message from that address.  You can set a "Remove Old Entries" to "on"
and set "Days until removal" to the maximum elapsed days from the last
message from an address and your address database will be "self
cleaning".  Note that settings related to "Remove Old Entries" will be
ignored if "Enable Address Saving" is not "on".

<p>For a "hand maintained" address database, set "Enable Address
Saving" to "off".  When you are viewing a message with a sender whose
address you wish to keep, press the key defined in the "Key to save an
address" field (default is Ctrl-Tab).

<h3>Address Expansion: using data from the Address Database</h3>

<p><b>Note:</b> Address expansion is only supported in the <a
href="Sedit.html">exmh Simple Editor (Sedit)</a>.

<p>The Address Database can be used to help you address email by using
the Sedit "&lt;addrexpand&gt;" key.  That key defaults to Control-Tab but may
be changed using the Binding.../Simple Edit menu item of the main exmh
window.

<p>Address expansion by Address Database lookup is performed by typing
a partial name or address in your message (on the "To:", "cc:",
"bcc:", or "dcc:" line) and pressing the "&lt;addrexpand&gt;" key.  You can
expand multiple names, one at a time, by typing a comma followed by
another partial name or address and pressing the "&lt;addrexpand&gt;" key
again.

<h3><a href="AddrEdit.html">The Address Database Browser</a></h3>

<p>You can browse and edit your Address Database using the somewhat
misnamed <a href="AddrEdit.html">Address DB Browser</a>.  This is
accessed from the Address.../Address Book menu item of the main
exmh window.

<h3>Fine tuning your Address Database</h3>

<ul>

<li>People with multiple addresses

<p>The Address Database does not attempt to recognize that one person
can have multiple email addresses or email address variations.  Each
different address string is treated as a separate entity.

<p>You can streamline lookup of people who send you mail from multiple
addresses by using the "exclude" facility of the <a
href="AddrEdit.html">Address DB Browser</a>.  Select the address you
normally use to send mail to the person and mark all other addresses
as excluded.  <i>Do not</i> delete the addresses you don't normally
use for sending as they will just be added back in the next time you
receive mail from that address.

<br>
<br>
<li>Filtering

<p>You may want to prevent mail from certain names such as "root" or
mail stored in certain folders such as high-volume mailing lists from
automatically causing updates to the Address Database.  All email
addresses listed as "Alternate-Mailboxes:" in your .mh_profile will be
automatically ignored.

<p>Filtering is controlled from the Address Database Preferences panel.  If the
"From" address for a particular message is not being updated due to
your preference settings you can still force it to be stored by
pressing the key defined in the "Key to save an address" preference
setting.  The default setting is Control-Tab.

</ul>

<h3>Idiosyncrasies and limitations of the Address Database</h3>
<ul>

<li>The Address Database does not support lists of addresses, one entry
can only contain one email address, you should use MH Aliases for
lists of addresses.

<br>
<br>
<li>The Address Database only supports expansion of partial addresses
on email address lines of a message (i.e., the "To:", "cc:", "bcc:",
"dcc:", "Redistribute-to", "Redistribute-cc" lines).  Address
expansion cannot be performed on continuation lines.

<p>If you have set Sedit to break lines while typing and enter more
than one address for expansion the line may be broken by Sedit.  In
this situation it will be necessary for you to temporarily turn off
line breaking and join any continuation lines.

<br>
<br>
<li>The Address Database maintains a pointer to the last mail message
received for each entry.  This pointer is only valid if you have not
packed, moved, or deleted the message as it is only changed when you
view a message.

<br>
<br>
<li>Address database entries in the browser are initially sorted in
alphabetical order by the text name and then by the email address.

<p>However new entries are <i>not</i> sorted as they are added to the
Address DB Browser.  You will find new entries at the end rather than
in their proper place in the alphabet.  You may resort the list
presented in the browser at any time using the Database.../Sort menu
item.

</ul>

<h3>Origins of the Address Database</h3>
<p>The exmh Address Database code was originally written by Berry
Kercheval and was inspired by BBDB, the Insidious Big Brother
Database, an Emacs add-in.
