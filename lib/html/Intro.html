<h1 align=center>Quick Intro to Exmh</h1>
<p>
Bugs and comments to Brent Welch, <a href="mailto:Welch@acm.org">Welch@acm.org</a>


<h2>Folder Display </h2>
<p>
Exmh displays three panes of information. The top pane has a label
for each of your MH folders. Each label is highlighted to reflect the
state of the folder. There is one current folder, whose table of contents
is displayed in the second pane. There is one folder that is the target
for move operations. There may be several folders that have unread
messages in them. Select <button -command Help_KeyDisplay>Color Legend</button>
from the Help menu to display the key of how folder labels are highlighted.
In addition, folders with nested sub-folders have a shadow-box highlight.


<h3>Selecting Folders with the Mouse</h3>
<p>
Left click on a folder label to <strong>view</strong> the messages
in it. 
<p>
Right click on a folder label to <strong>move</strong> the current
message(s) to the folder. 
<p>
Shift-Right on a label to <strong>link</strong> the current message(s)
to the folder. 
<p>
Middle click on a label to view the nested folders beneath it. 

<h2>Folder Table of Contents</h2>
<p>
The middle and bottom panes are text windows. Each of these can be
scrolled by using the scrollbar or by dragging the display with the
middle mouse button. 
<p>
The middle pane lists the messages in the current folder, which comes
from the output of the MH <em>scan</em> command. The display indicates
the state of the message: (See <button -command Help_KeyDisplay>Color
Legend</button> under Help to see how these are marked on your display)

<ul>
<li>current message. 
<li>messages marked for delete. 
<li>message marked for movement to another folder. 
<li>unread messages. 
</ul>
<h3>Selecting Messages with the Mouse</h3>
<p>
Left clicking on an entry causes the message to be displayed in the
third, or bottom pane. 
<p>
Right clicking selects a message but does not display it. 
<p>
Dragging a selection with the Left button selects a range of messages.
You can update a selection with Shift-Left. 
<p>
Message operations like Delete, Move, Link Unmark, and Print will operate
on the whole selected set of messages. 

<h2>Message Display</h2>
<p>
The bottom window displays the current message. If you get a MIME message
(i.e., multipart or multimedia) the right button brings up a menu that
lets you manipulate the parts of MIME messages. Press the right button
somewhere over the message part you are interested in. 
<p>
Exmh supports a large number of <a HREF="Keys.html">keyboard shortcuts</a>
so you can keep your hands on the keyboard. 

<h2>Resizing Sub-windows</h2>
<p>
The black diamond to the right of the status line is used to change
the boundary between the internal sub-windows. To get an idea of how
it works, press the first mouse button over the diamond. Drag the horizontal
line up to the top of the window and back down to the bottom. Watch
the status line to see what sub-window boundary you are changing. 

<h2>Command buttons</h2>
<p>
Command buttons are grouped into three sets. The top is for global
operations. The middle set is for folder operations. The bottom set
is for message operations. 

<h3>Global Commands</h3>
<p>
The top set of buttons is for global commands: Log, Help..., Bindings...,
Preferences, Aliases and Quit. 
<p>
Log appears if you enable logging in your Preferences. The log contains
a record of actions taken, including debugging info I put in. 
<p>
Under Help, Quick Intro gives you this window. FAQ shows the Frequently-Asked-Questions
file. 
<p>
You are encouraged to register as an exmh user, too. All this does
is open a mail draft to me in which you can send your pro and con opinions
about exmh. There is no obligation associated with registration. 
<p>
The Preferences dialog gives you some control over exmh features. Within
this dialog you can get more help on setting preferences by clicking
the Help button that is part of that dialog. 

<h3>Message Commands</h3>
<p>
The bottom set of buttons are for message operations: 
<p>
Link - link a message into the target folder and go to the next message.
<br>

Move - move a message to the target folder and go to the next message.
<br>

Delete - mark the current message for deletion and go to the next
message. 
<br>

Next - move to the next message. This will chain to the next folder
with unread messages if you are at the end of the current folder. <br>

Prev - move to the previous message. 
<br>

Comp - compose a mail message. In the drafts folder, this opens the
current message as the draft. 
<br>

Reply... - a menu of reply choices. There are two choices by default,
and instructions for adding more. 
<br>

Reply to sender - reply to the current message (-nocc cc -nocc to)
<br>

Reply all - reply to the current message (-cc cc -cc to). 
<br>

Forward - forward the current message. 
<p>
More... - a menu with more message operations: 
<br>

Print - print the current message. 
<br>

Unmark - cancel a move or delete mark. 
<br>

Clip - make a new window containing the current message. 
<br>

First Unseen - show the first unseen message. 
<br>

Burst Digest - use the MH burst command to explode a digest into messages.
<br>

Redistribute - use the MH dist command to remail a message. 
<p>
And many more. Check out the <a HREF="exmh-ref.n.html">exmh-ref</a>
man page for details. 
<h4>UNDO</h4>
<p>
The Move, Link, and Delete operations mark a message with a pending
operation. The way to undo this mark is to reselect the message(s)
and select the Unmark operation from the More... menu. 

<h3>Folder Commands</h3>
<p>
The middle set of buttons are for folder commands: New, Search...,
Flist, Inc, Commit, and More... 
<p>
New brings up a dialog that lets you create new folders. (A Delete
folder operation is under the More... menu.) 
<p>
Find causes a search dialog to appear. You can search over the message
body (Msg), or the scan listing (FTOC). Radio buttons select which
one. After typing in the search string, causes the search to begin.
&lt;Control-s&gt; and &lt;Control-r&gt; cause subsequent forward and
reverse searches, respectively. 
<p>
The Flist button refreshes the display of folder buttons. This counts
up all the unseen messages in all folders. 
<p>
Commit causes pending delete and move operations to occur. This command
is also bound to keystroke &lt;Return&gt;. 
<h4>Incorporating Mail</h4>
<p>
The Inc button will incorporate new mail from your spool file into
your mail folders. Exmh knows about three styles of Inc, which you
choose via the Preferences dialog. 
<ul>
<li>"inbox" Inc moves new messages into your inbox folder. 
<li>"presort" Inc will run the MH filtering hook, slocal, for you if
there are messages in your spool file. 
<li>"multidrop" Inc moves new messages into "dropboxes" by means of
the standard slocal and ~/.maildelivery filtering, and then inc's from
these dropboxes into folders. For this to work, you need to list your
dropbox names in a ~/.xmhcheck file. Dropbox names can be hostnames
(no slashes...) in which case POP is used. 
<li>Select "none" for inc if you have an external agent that presorts
mail for you. In this case, "background flist" will highlight folders
that have new mail in them. 
</ul>
<h3>Searching</h3>
<p>
Exmh provides several search mechanisms under the Search menu. The
Search Message command searches for a string in the current message.
The Search Table of Contents searches the folder table of contents
for a string. The Glimpse search engine can search all your mail folders.

<h4>Pick</h4>
<p>
Pick provides an interface to the MH pick command. The dialog initially
displays entry widgets labeled Subject, From, To, Cc, Before, and After.
You can enter a pattern for any of these, and pick selects messages
that satisfy the logical AND of these pattern specifications. Note
that the Before and After patterns are date-specific, and pick understands
many forms of date patterns. Read the MH man page for pick for the
complete story. You can build up more complex logical search expressions
by clicking the Or button. 
<p>
The Messages entry lets you limit pick to a specific set of messages.
In particular, you can specify a sequence name (e.g., "unseen"), and
have pick find all messages with that sequence identifier. 
<p>
After the pick completes, a range of messages is selected that satisfies
the search. If you choose "Add to Sel", then the picked messages will
be added to the currently selected set. Choose this <em>before</em>
the Pick. Otherwise a new selection is made. 
<p>
If you choose "New FTOC", then the selected messages will replace the
current list of messages displayed in the folder table of contents.
"Mark Seen" will remove messages from the unseen sequence. 
<p>
Pick uses the MH pick program, which runs a bit slowly, so have patience.
BUG: if you have projected a New FTOC, a subsequent pick will only
select messages still on the display. You need to rescan the folder
to start over. Sigh. 

<h3>Miscellaneous Folder Operations</h3>
<p>
The More... menu has more folder operations: 
<p>
"Rescan folder" forces a rescan of the folder contents. Exmh maintains
a cache of the scan output that could get confused. The Rescan button
forces a full scan. To optimistically rescan the current folder, click
on its label in the top pane instead. 
<p>
"Sort folders" sorts the current folder by message date. 
<p>
"Pack folders" renumbers messages in the current folder to eliminate
any gaps in the number sequence. 
<p>
"Find all folders" recurses through the directory structure looking
for all MH folder directories. 
<p>
"Delete folder" lets you delete a folder. 
<p>
There are more entries here. Check the <a HREF="exmh-ref.n.html">exmh-ref</a>
man page for details.
