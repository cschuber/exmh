<h1 align=center>Address DB Browser Help</h1>
<p>
The Address DB Browser window is accessed from the Addresses.../Address
Book menu item in the exmh main window. This window allows you to view
the contents of the Address Database and operate on the contents of
the database.
<p>
The Browser window shows a formatted and sorted list of mail addresses
as in the example below. The full name and email address are shown.
In addition the presence of a "-" preceding the email address indicates
that the record is marked for exclusion from searches. 
<pre>
Brent B. Welch            &lt;welch@acm.org&gt;
Brent B. Welch          - &lt;brent.welch@scriptics.com&gt;
</pre>

<p>
At the bottom of the Address DB Browser window is an entry field
labeled <b>Find</b>.  Text entered in the Find field will applied as
a case-insensitive regular expression filter to the records in the
Address Database and only matching records will be displayed.

<p>After using <b>Find</b>, to return to viewing all records it is
necessary to delete any text entered in the Find field and press enter.

<br>

<br>



<h3>Address DB Browser Buttons</h3>
<p>
The following buttons are available in the Address DB Browser window:

<dl>
<br>
<dt>Help
<dd>Shows this help.

<br>
<br>
<dt>New <dd>Pops up a window that allows you to manually introduce a new
address in the addresses database.

<p>The following fields exist in this window:
<p>
<dl>
<dt>Full Name
<dd>The "text name" of the person associated with this
email address and it may be blank.

<br>
<br>
<dt>Address
<dd>This is the email address of the person. Don't add the angle brackets
to it ("&lt;&gt;") as they will be added when needed.
</dl>

<br>
<br>
<dt><a href="#dbmenu">Database...</a>
<dd>Pops up the 
<a href="#dbmenu">Database... menu</a>, 
a group of operations on the entire database.

<br>
<br>
<dt><a href="#selmenu">Selected...</a>
<dd>Pops up the
<a href="#selmenu">Selected Records menu</a>.
Items available in this menu operate on the currently selected record
or records in the database.  

<br>
<br>
<p>
This menu is disabled when no records are
selected.  Selection of records is accomplished by clicking or
dragging using mouse button 1 and may also be done using the keyboard
arrow keys and spacebar.

<br>
<br>
<dt>Dismiss
<dd>Closes the Address Database Browser window

</dl>

<br>
<br>

<h4><a name=dbmenu>Database... menu</a></h4>
<br>
<dl>
<dt>Save &lt;Meta-s&gt;
<dd>
<p>
Pressing the <b>Save</b> button or the &lt;Meta-s&gt; key unconditionally
writes the current contents of the complete Address Database to disk.
Note that the Address Database will also be saved when exmh exits
normally and <i>may</i> optionally be saved each time you change the
current folder if the database has changed <b>and</b> if "Checkpoint
on folder change" is set to "on" in the Address Database Preference
panel.
<br>


<br>


<dt>Reload &lt;Meta-r&gt;
<dd>
<p>
Pressing the <b>Reload</b> button or the &lt;Meta-r&gt; key causes the
current contents of the complete address database to be discarded and
the last saved file to be reread.  If the database has changed you
will be prompted to confirm the reload to prevent inadvertent loss of
changes.
<br>


<br>


<dt>Sort &lt;Meta-t&gt;
<dd>
<p>
Pressing the <b>Sort</b> button or the &lt;Meta-t&gt; key causes the
contents of the address browser list to be resorted.  This may
occasionally be desirable since new database entries are added to the
end of the browser list for performance reasons.
<br>


<br>

</dl>
<br>
<br>

<h4><a name=selmenu>Selected Records menu</a></h4>
<p>
Items in the <b>Selected...</b> menu operate on the currently
selected record or records and are only available when records have
been selected in the Address Browser listbox.

<br>
<br>
<dl>
<dt>Edit 
<dd>
<p>
Pressing the <b>Edit</b> button will open an <a href="#dbedit">Address
DB Editor</a> window for each selected record.  A single record can be
quickly edited by double-clicking mouse button 1 on a record in the
Address DB Browser.

<br>
<br>
<dt>Delete &lt;Control-w&gt;
<dd>
<p>
Pressing the <b>Delete</b> button or the &lt;Control-w&gt; key removes all
the selected record from the database.  No confirmation will be
requested but the change is not committed to disk until the Address DB
is saved.

<br>
<br>
<dt>Toggle Excluded &lt;Meta-x&gt;
<dd>
<p>
Pressing the <b>Toggle Excluded</b> button or the &lt;Meta-x&gt; key will
invert the "excluded" flag for all selected records.  This can also be
done by clicking mouse button 2 in the list box with records selected.
No confirmation will be requested but the change is not committed to
disk until the Address DB is saved.

<br>
<br>
<dt>View Last Msg 
<dd>
<p>
Pressing the <b>View Last Msg</b> button will cause a new window to be
opened for each selected address.  The windows will contain the last
message received from the selected address(es).  Note that this may
give incorrect results if the selected message was moved, the folder
was packed, or the message was deleted.  The Address Database field
containing the last message information is only updated when an
address is saved.

<br>

The <b>Address DB Editor</b> is used to change the contents or exclusion
status of a single record in the Address Database. 

<h3>Address DB Editor Fields</h3>

of contents is done so preserving valid data is strictly up to you.

<dl>
<dt>Full Name 
<dd>The "text name" of the person associated with this email address.
This may be blank. It is not necessary to provide quotation marks around
addresses containing commas or other restricted characters as the Address
Database will automatically provide them when needed. 

<br>
<br>
<dt>Address 
<dd>This will display the fully formatted address containing the full
name (quoted if necessary) and the email address. The email address
will be enclosed in angle brackets ("&lt;&gt;") if there is a full
name. 

<br>
<br>
<p>
<b>If you alter this field you should <i>only</i> enter a valid email
address.</b> 

<br>
<br>
<dt><a name=lastmsgfield>Last Message</a> 
<dd>This field will contain the fully qualified filename of the last
message received from this address. It will only be correct if you
have not packed the folder, moved the message, or deleted the message.
This field is used when you press the <b>Last Msg</b> button in the
Address DB Browser. 

<br>
<br>
<dt>Date 
<dd>This field will contain the contents of the Date: header from the
message pointed to by the <a href="#lastmsgfield">Last Message</a> field
above. When displaying messages in exmh this field is used to determine
if the <a href="#lastmsgfield">Last Message</a> field should be updated.
