<h1><center>What is exmh?</center> </h1>
<em>An Introduction by the author, <a HREF="http://www.beedub.com/">Brent

<p>
Exmh is an X user interface for MH mail. MH provides a set of UNIX
commands that manage folders and mail messages. MH has a zillion features
as a result of several years of availability. Exmh provides a graphical
interface to many of these features, but not everything. You can do
all the ordinary things like viewing the messages in a folder, and
reading, deleting, and refiling messages. In addition, the interface
handles arbitrary nesting of your folder hierarchy. 
<p>
What exmh supports well is sorting arriving mail into different folders
before you even read them. You can sort with the MH .maildelivery filtering
mechanism, procmail, or any system that adds new messages to the unseen
sequence of a folder. exmh provides an easy way to find newly arrived
messages after they have been squirreled away. It highlights what folders
have new mail, and within a folder it indicates which messages have
not yet been read. 
<p>
MIME format messages are parsed and displayed. <a HREF="http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/MIME/MIME.html">MIME</a>
is a multi-media mail standard that allows transmission of images,
audio, enriched text, FTP pointers, etc. via email. While there is
some support for composing MIME messages in the current version, the
composition facilities need a little more work. 
<p>
You can use your favorite editor to compose mail messages, or you can
use a simple built-in editor that provides some Emacs-like keybindings.
With the built-in editor you can compose text/enriched (<b>bold</b>,
<i>italic</i>, underline, etc.), and you can create multipart messages
by inserting files of various MIME types. 
<p>
Exmh is written in <a HREF="http://www.scriptics.com/">TCL/TK</a>
. The implementation is open and flexible. There are several levels
of customization: 
<ul>
<li>Each module of the implementation exports a few knobs and dials
in a preference interface. There about 20 modules, so there are altogether
way to many knobs at this point. But, hey, the table-driven implementation
makes it easy to export settings. 
<li>The button and menu structure is defined via X resources, You can
easily add more buttons or menus to invoke new functionality that you
add to exmh. 
<li>TK widget attributes such as colors, fonts, and cursors, are controlled
by X resources. You add make site-wide or personal resource definitions
to tune the appearance of exmh. 
<li>Exmh supports a personal library of Tcl extensions. You can provide
new functionality and add a button for it. In addition you can override
parts of the implementation. This area could be stronger with the addition
of more hook points so you do not have to override a whole module,
but this will improve over time.

<h2>THANKS</h2>
To Sun Microsystems Laboratories and my manager, John Ousterhout, for
supporting my current exmh work, and to the Computer Science Lab at
Xerox PARC, which supported the initial development of exmh. 
<p>
Many thanks to <a HREF="http://habanero.ucs.indiana.edu/~shutton">Scott
Hutton</a> who took my feeble attempt at an exmh home page, plus my
on-line manuals, and produced a nice set of web pages.
