<h1 align=center>Sedit </h1>
<p>
Sedit is a simple editor built into exmh. The editor works on draft
messages that are kept in your MH draft folder. When you do Compose,
Reply, or Forward, a new draft is created for you.
<p>
You can customize the <a HREF="Seditpref.html">key bindings</a> for
this editor.
<p>
Here is what the buttons do:
<p>
Abort - remove the draft message from the drafts folder. The editor
window is removed.
<p>
Save&amp;Quit - saves the message in the draft folder but does not
send it.
<p>
Help - displays this window.
<p>
Quote... - Bring up a menu with the following options (replies only):
<ul>
<p>
Quote - Insert a copy of the current message.  See the
Quote preferences for information about customizing the copy of the
message.
<p>
Quote MIME - Attach a copy of the current message as a part into a
multipart MIME message.
</ul>
<p>
Send - saves and posts the message. By default it is removed from the
draft folder when you do this, unless you select Keep on Send.
<p>
Sign - append your .signature file to the message. If you have autoSign
set, or multiple files match .signature* then this button is replaced
with the following menu.
<p>
Sign... - Select the signature file for the message. It is added when
you select it, or when you Send the message if you have the autoSign
Preferences item enabled. In this case, if you select the intelligent
option, one of the signature files specified under the Intelligent
Signatures Preferences option is used, depending upon the destination
of the message.
<p>
Text... - apply text/enriched formatting to the current selection.

<p>
Crypt... - Options for encrypting and/or signing your message. Use format
to specify email encoding (plain, application/pgp or MIME multipart). The
version submenu controls the application used. The sign submenu selects the
signing method or if we should sign AND encrypt. The encrypt checkbox
indicates if the message is to be encrypted for the recipients (where
an Fcc: header automatically makes the author a recipient). If the author
has more than one private key the "Choose Key" option allows for the
key selection. Finally, for those that cache their passphrases the
"Clear Passphrase(s)" allows for clearing the cache.

<p>
More... - Bring up a menu with the following options:
<ul>
  <p>
  Keep on Send - if this button is highlighted, then Send will not remove
the editor window and the draft will remain in the drafts folder after
you send it.
  <p>
  Format mail - this breaks long lines (&gt; 79 characters) at word boundaries.

  <p>
  Attempt mhbuild - run the message body through mhbuild before sending. If you
know the # directives of mhbuild, you can use this quick hack to compose
MIME messages.
  <p>
  Quoted Printable Text - make the content transfer encoding of regular
text messages quoted printable to protect 8-bit characters.
  <p>
  Ask for Receipt - Add a Disposition-notification-to header to the mail.
This will request a receipt to the address in the header field.
  <p>
  Attachment... - Bring up a sub-menu with the following options:
  <ul>
    <p>
    Attach File... - Attach a file as a part into a multipart MIME message.
    <p>
    Attach Message... - Attach a message as a part into a multipart MIME
message.
    <p>
    Attach Reference... - Attach a message/external-body part as a
reference to a FTP file or a local file.
    <p>
    Insert File... - Insert a file directly into the message.
  </ul>
  <p>
  Whom - displays the list of recipients for the message.
  <p>
  Spell... - run your spell program over the message body. Select this
with the spell preferences for the Simple Editor.
  <p>
  Find SEL - search the message body for the selected string.
  <p>
Save Buffer - write out the editor buffer to disk. This is only for
paranoid folks. The Save&amp;Quit button or Keep on Send options actually
result in the draft remaining. This Save button just writes the buffer
to disk but does not change the default behavior of renaming drafts
after you send them.
  <p>
  Run mhbuild now - Pre-process the message with the mhbuild program and put the
results into the editor buffer.
  <p>
  Mime Preview - Display the message as it will be seen by an exmh user.
  <p>
  Alternate Editor - switch to using your alternate editor.
</ul>
<p>
Filter -
The Unix filter mechanism provides an entry widget where you
	can specify an arbitrary Unix command line.  Once specified,
	selecting a region of text and hitting "Filter" has the effect
	of sending the selected text through the filter, and replacing
	it with whatever the filter produced.  An "Undo" mechanism is
	provided in the event that the filter does not have the desired
	effect.  Moreover, each unique filter you execute is stored in a
	history mechanism, accessible via the "History" menu adjacent to
	the text entry field.
