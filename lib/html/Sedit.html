<h1 align=center>Sedit </h1>
<p>
Sedit is a simple editor built into exmh. The editor works on draft
messages that are kept in your MH draft folder. When you do Compose,
Reply, or Forward, a new draft is created for you. 
<p>
You can customize the <a HREF="Seditpref.html">key bindings</a> for
this editor. 
<p>
Here is what the buttons do: 
<p>
Abort - remove the draft message from the drafts folder. The editor
window is removed. 
<p>
Save&amp;Quit - saves the message in the draft folder but does not
send it. 
<p>
Help - displays this window. 
<p>
Quote - Insert a copy of the current message (replies only).  See the
Quote preferences for information about customizing the copy of the
message.
<p>
Send - saves and posts the message. By default it is removed from the
draft folder when you do this, unless you select Keep on Send. 
<p>
Sign - append your .signature file to the message. If you have autoSign
set, or multiple files match .signature* then this button is replaced
with the following menu. 
<p>
Sign... - Select the signature file for the message. It is added when
you select it, or when you Send the message if you have the autoSign
Preferences item enabled. In this case, if you select the intelligent
option, one of the signature files specified under the Intelligent
Signatures Preferences option is used, depending upon the destination
of the message.
<p>
Text... - apply text/enriched formatting to the current selection.

<p>
More... - Bring up a menu with the following options: 
<p>
Keep on Send - if this button is highlighted, then Send will not remove
the editor window and the draft will remain in the drafts folder after
you send it. 
<p>
Format mail - this breaks long lines (&gt; 79 characters) at word boundaries.

<p>
Attempt mhn - run the message body through mhn before sending. If you
know the # directives of mhn, you can use this quick hack to compose
MIME messages. 
<p>
Quoted Printable Text - make the content transfer encoding of regular
text messages quoted printable to protect 8-bit characters. 
<p>
Ask for Receipt - Add a Disposition-notification-to header to the mail.
This will request a receipt to the address in the header field. 
<p>
Insert File... - Insert a file directly into the message. 
<p>
Insert Part... - Insert a file as a part into a multipart MIME message.

<p>
Insert External... - Insert a message/external-body part, which is
a reference to a FTP file or a local file. 
<p>
Whom - displays the list of recipients for the message. 
<p>
Spell... - run your spell program over the message body. Select this
with the spell preferences for the Simple Editor. 
<p>
Find SEL - search the message body for the selected string. 
<p>
Save Buffer - write out the editor buffer to disk. This is only for
paranoid folks. The Save&amp;Quit button or Keep on Send options actually
result in the draft remaining. This Save button just writes the buffer
to disk but does not change the default behavior of renaming drafts
after you send them. 
<p>
Run mhn now Pre-process the message with the mhn program and put the
results into the editor buffer. 
<p>
Mime Preview - Display the message as it will be seen by an exmh user.

<p>
Alternate Editor - switch to using your alternate editor.
