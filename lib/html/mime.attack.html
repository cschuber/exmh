<h2><center>FLASH: Exmh unaffected by MIME "long filename" attack</center> </h2>
(7/27/98)
News articles about security flaws in Microsoft and Netscape mail
readers concern an attack on MIME handling.
Exmh implements MIME handling in Tcl code that is unaffected by
buffer overflow type attacks.  There are no fixed sized buffers
in the implementation of Tcl itself, so it is not possible to
trick Exmh into executing arbitrary code by sending it
MIME attachments with extremely long file names.
<p>
Exmh does, however, rely on the MH package for many other mail handling
functions.  This is a very old code base that may be susceptible to
various buffer overflow attacks.  In particular, if you use the 
"mhn" program to read MIME messages from the UNIX command line, you
may or may not be subject to the attack.  Again, Exmh does not use
this program to read MIME messages, so reading MIME messages in
Exmh is safe from the particular attack described
in the news media.
<p>
However, we currently recommend that MH users switch
to the "nmh" replacement for MH (not to be confused with the
afore-mentioned "mhn" component of MH).  The nmh package is a major clean up
of the MH code base.  For starters, it is much easier to compile
and install nmh than MH.  There are many bug fixes and other enhancements
to the code as well.  For more information, see the
