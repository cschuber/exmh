<h1>Mailing Lists For exmh</h1><em>by Brent Welch</em>
<p>
There are three mailing lists for exmh.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>exmh-announce@redhat.com</b> receives occasional messages about new releases of exmh. The traffic is rather light. 
<li><b>exmh-users@redhat.com</b> is for general Q&amp;A about exmh. The traffic can be high, but that's why you use a mail reader that supports filters. You can divert all the junk mail into a folder and read it later. <em>NOTE</em>: This list gets all the exmh-announce traffic too. Do not subscribe to both. 
<li><b>exmh-workers@redhat.com</b> is for folks that like to hack on the implementation. Post your nifty exmh Tcl extension here, or patches that fix bugs, and so on. 
<br><em>NOTE</em>: This lists <i>no longer</i>gets all the exmh-users traffic,
so you may choose to subscribe to either or both of exmh-users and exmh-workers. 
</ul>


<p>
These messages are controlled by the SmartList mailing list manager. To subscribe to a list, send a message to exmh-<i>list</i>-request with a subscribe command in the <b>Subject</b> header. Exmh provides menu entries under the <strong>Help</strong> menu that compose these messages automatically.  For example, to subscribe to exmh-announce, your mail message would look like this:
<p>

<pre>
-------------cut here-----------
To: exmh-announce-request@redhat.com
Subject: subscribe
From: (the address you want to subscribe) &lt;welch@acm.org&gt;

What's in the body doesn't matter.
-------------end of file--------
</pre>

To get a complete list of commands, send a message containing the command <b>help</b> to the address 
<a HREF="mailto:exmh-users@redhat.com">exmh-users@redhat.com</a>
