<h1 align=center>Aliases and Addresses Help</h1>
<p>
Exmh supports two different address books, you can use either or
both.  They are independent of each other.  The two address books are:
<ul>
<li><a href="Aliases.html">the MH Aliases list</a>
<li><a href="AddressBk.html">the exmh Address Database</a>
</ul>

<p>MH Aliases, as the name implies, are a capability of the MH
foundation upon which exmh is built and can be used with other MH tools.
The exmh Address Database is supported solely within exmh.
