<H1>A Brief Overview of exmh</H1>

<EM>by Brent Welch</EM><P>

The exmh display is divided into three main displays.  At the top is an
array of labels that correspond to each of your toplevel mail folders.
These are highlighted in different ways to indicate their state.  The
blue labels have new messages in them.  The labels with a drop shadow
have folders nested under them.  In the picture, the exmh folder has a
little popup that lists the folders nested under it.  The current
folder is outlined in red.  If you are refiling messages into another
folder, then the target folder will be yellow.  The Color Legend entry
under the Help... menu
brings up a key that explains the highlighting.  On a monochrome
screen, the highlighting is done with bitmaps, underlining, and
stippling in order to provide similar feedback.  <P>

(The picture is not up-to-date, but it is pretty close.
The current exmh version is 1.6beta,
which was released in March 1995.) <P>

Right under the main folder label display is a cache of recently visited
folders.  These are equivalent to the labels in the main display and
are just there for  commonly used folders.  (Right now this is managed
in a strict LRU fashion, and that needs to be improved.) <P>

The middle part of the display shows the results of the MH scan command
that summarizes the messages in your folder.  Again, color highlighting
is used to indicate the current message, unseen messages, and messages
that are marked for delete or refile into another folder.  These
pending changes are committed when you click the Commit button, or when
you change folders and you have the autoCommit preference item
chosen.<P>

The bottom part of the display shows the current message.  You can set
up different headers to have different color highlights.  Some of the
less interesting headers start off scrolled off the top of the
display.  An image of the person that sent the message, or possibly
their company's logo, may be displayed just above and to the left of the
message area.

<H2>Preferences</H2>

There are a growing number of knobs and dials for exmh itself, and
these are controlled via a Preferences user interface.  The preferences
are saved in your ~/.exmh-defaults file as a set of X resource
specifications.  In addition, you can tweak colors and fonts and other
TK widget attributes via X resources.<P>

There are so many knobs and dials, in fact, that they are divided into
sections that correspond to various modules of the implementation.  The
whole thing is table driven and you might be interested in using it for
your own TK application.  The following shows the toplevel preferences
window and one of the module-specific preferences windows.<P>
