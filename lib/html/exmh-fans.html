I like exmh because... it so damn nice!  And the mime support is great.  
Perhaps the most impressive and useful free X applications I seen.  XV is a 
close second.

I like exmh because...it does more than any other mail program.

	It is the most complete E-Mail GUI for X11 that I have encountered.
	The MIME support is great. User extensibility (such as providing for
	embedded URI references) is a great feature.

It provides a friendly X user interface to multiple mail folders, including
automatic filing capabilities.

It makes it possible to handle lots of messages, especially refiling them -
my inbox used to build up to thousands of messages because refiling was a
pain (more commands to type); now, a quick right-click... the recently-used
folder list is very useful for this: I have a folder for each of the people
I correspond with, so there are enough that I don't want to see them all on
the screen at once, but the cached list (with two lines) hits often enough
that it's not a problem to deiconify the main folder list window for the
few that miss. I like the LRU scheme for replacement.

I find it more convenient and easier to use than any other mailing system I've
used previously - not that I've used a lot...

<LI>it's well conceived, tasteful, and well supported.

I like exmh because it's the best. I haven't seen any tool other than real
 expensive ones that let me cope with several hundreds mail per day with this
 ease. Not only is it efficient and easy to use, it's powerful and high-tech!
 Just one example: for the first time I can really make use of my 2048-bit 
 pgp-key! (:

I don't really like the richness of configurations and possibilities in exmh.
 It's far too well-equipped and richly designed (-: Nah, I can't find anything
 to complain about with Exmh, I really can't. Often when I find out about
 something to that might be a problem it's when the workaround or a patch
 is posted to exmh-users. So generally I just think it's a great mail-handler!

I like exmh because... 
<UL>
    <LI>It's not DEC's painful dxmail.
    <LI>I can see the source for it.
    <LI>It's widely used.
    <LI>It's readily extensible.
    <LI>There's a wide and vocal community of people
                             discussing bug fixes and common mistakes.

I like exmh because it's really cool, and even better than zmail.
Can help me deal with lot's of email messages per day, say 500.

I like exmh because...
<UL>
<LI>Good installation process
<LI>Scan caching is nice - gives exmh good performance characteristics
<LI>Background processing capability
<LI>Message facility.  You should play this up more.  It was real easy to
    put a shell in my .maildelivery file that causes exmh to 
    de-iconify and change folder to, say my boss's folder, when my manager
    sends e-mail.

It saves me about one hour per day. 
I started using exmh earlier this year.  We now have about a dozen users.

	It does things that other mailers do not do.  The support
and new features from the author are excellent.  Just when I find
a new things that can be done with mail, you implement it for the
next release.

It supports mime messages, multiple mail drops, user tweaks, but probably 
most of all because it is being actively improved. After a very short 
learning period it became my first choice mail reader. Other people here 
who I've shown it too have had the same reaction.

Overall I find exmh to be a very good product and I am always telling people 
about it.  We have ZMail as the default GUI based mail handler, when people 
start complaining how slow it is and how much it crashes I tell them I have a 
fix :-).  I convert their zmail folders into mh folders and away we go.
Thanks for all your work, exmh is a wonderful package.

    <LI>It is based on standard MH, so I can still use the good old MH commands
   over a SL/IP link
    <LI>It supports MIME well
    <LI>Performance is pretty reasonable
    <LI>It's simple the best mailer around I've seen (for SMTP mail). I keep 
   telling my friends about it. Thoroughly recommended. You've done a
   brilliant job
    <LI>I've really struggled to find anything bad - there isn't really!
