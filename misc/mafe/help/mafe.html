<A NAME="intro"><H2>Introduction</H2>
<p>MAFE is a Perl+Tk utility which manipulates the nmh alias file(s).  It
can add email aliases, delete them and change them.  It is  similar in
style to <tt>aliases.tcl</tt> by Brent Welch and Scott Stanton in the standard exmh
package, but has a little more functionality.  Unfortunately, my TCL+TK
knowledge is limited and it would have taken me too long to learn the
language to do what I wanted to do, so I've used what I know: Perl.
However, if anyone wishes to convert this to Tcl, they are most
welcome.  This is not meant to critize <tt>aliases.tcl</tt> by any means.
Indeed, <tt>aliases.tcl</tt> is much faster than mafe and is native to exmh
(whereas mafe needs to be called via exec, see below).</p>

<p>mafe uses two features of nmh alias file(s) which is not currently
exploited in the exmh alias editor: 
<ol>
<li>nmh can
allow for several alias files, which are all specified on one line in
.mh_profile, namely,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>AliasFile: .mh_aliases_research&nbsp;&nbsp;
.mh_aliases_friends&nbsp;&nbsp; .mh_aliases_family </tt><br>
<li>nmh alias files can the format<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>friends: All-Friends:, friend1@b.com,
friend2@c.edu, ... friend@z.ca, <b>;</b></tt><br>
(note the semicolon at the end as well as the comma usage) so that specifying <tt>friends</tt> in the <tt>To:</tt> field will result in the
recipients receiving the mail with <tt>To: All-Friends;</tt> in the header
rather than the entire list of emails.
</ol>
</p>

<HR>

<A NAME="terms"><H2>Terminology</H2>
<p>
As mentioned above, the nmh
file can take one of two basic forms:<br>
<table>
<tr><td>1:</td><td nowrap><font color="red"><tt>name</tt>: {<i>list</i>}</font></td></tr>
<tr><td>2:</td><td nowrap><font color="red"><tt>name</tt>: <tt>tag</tt>:,
{<i>list</i>}, ;</font></td></tr>
</table>
where {<i>list</i>} is a comma separated list of email addresses or
other aliases defined later in the file.  This help file makes use of
the following terminology:
<ul>
<li><b>Alias</b>: An alias will be defined as any line in the alias
file in the form of line 1.
<li><b>Alias name</b>: The <font color="red"><tt>name</tt></font> portion of the alias line.
<li><b>Distribution</b>: A distribution will be defined as any line in
the alias file in the form of line 2.
<li><b>Distribution name</b>: The <font color="red"><tt>name</tt></font> portion of the alias line.
<li><b>Tag</b> Any word(s) found in the <font color="red"><tt>tag</tt></font> location of a
Distribution line (line 2).  The tag is what the recipients of the
email will see in the <tt>To:</tt> field.
<li><b>Address</b> Any words found in the comma separated list of both
the Alias and Distribution lines.  Note that Address may be anther
Alias/Distribution found later in the alias file as well as email addresses.
</ul>
</p>

<HR>

<A NAME="install"><H2>Installation</H2>
<b><font size=+1>Requirements: </font></b>mafe requires the Perl::Tk modules.</p>

<p>Presently, there is no "installation" procedure (such as compiling or
rpm-ing).  Simply place uncompress the mafe tar file into a directory seen by the PATH
variable.  Mafe also comes with script called <tt>exmhmail</tt> (which
should also be visible to the PATH environment) which launches a compose
session in exmh.</p>

<p>To add mafe to exmh, add the following to the <i>beginning</i> of
<tt>exmh-defaults</tt>
<table>
<tr>
<td nowrap>
<tt>
*Main.addr.text:        Address...<BR>
*Main.addr.m.entrylist: alias alias2 addr<BR>
*Main.addr.m.l_alias: MH Aliases<BR>
*Main.addr.m.c_alias: Aliases_Pref<BR>
*Main.addr.m.l_alias2: MH Alias File Editor (MAFE)<BR>
*Main.addr.m.c_alias2: exec /<i>path to mafe</i>/mafe \$address &<BR>
*Main.addr.m.l_addr: Address Book<BR>
*Main.addr.m.c_addr: Addr_Browse<BR>
</tt>
</td></tr></table>

<hr>
<A NAME="usage"><H2>Usage</H2>

<p>The program <tt>mafe</tt> can be called from within <tt>exmh</tt> (as
described above) or can be called on its own via<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>mafe <i>address</i></tt>
where <tt><i>address</i></tt> will appear in the Addresses' Entry Box(see below).
</p>
<p>
When it first starts, <tt>mafe</tt> first reads
<tt>$HOME/.exmh/exmh-defaults</tt> to obtain which fonts are used by
<tt>exmh</tt>.  Next, it reads the file <tt>$HOME/.mh_profile</tt> and
looks for the alias file names given in the line starting with
<tt>AliasFile:</tt>.  It then proceeds to open the first alias file
mentioned on that line.
</p>

<H3>Layout</H3>
<p>
A screen shot of <tt>mafe</tt> is given below.  <br>
<img src="mafe_start.gif"><br><br>
In the upper right
corner are several buttons whose meaning is pretty much
self-explanatory. <br><img src="mafe_buttons.gif"><br>
The name of the nmh alias file is displayed at the
upper left.<br><img src="mafe_file.gif"><br>
  If there are more than one nmh alias (as specified in
<tt>.mh_profile</tt>) then the label is replaced with a pull down
combo-box to switch between different files.  <I>Note:</I> if a change
has been made to an alias file and has not been saved, then either
selecting a different alias file or
clicking the <B>Dismiss</B> dismiss button will result in the user to
be prompted to save the file first.
</p>

<p>
<A NAME="LS"><U><B>Left Side</B></U>:  On the left hand side of the window there are two nearly-identical
units above one another.  Each unit contains: a list box, an entry box and a row of
buttons.  With the exception of the last button in each set, all look
the same.  The upper unit is reserved for aliases (as defined in the
<A HREF="#intro">Introduction</A>) while the lower unit is reserved
for the distributions (again, as defined in the
<A HREF="#intro">Introduction</A>).<br>
<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="mafe_alias.gif"></td>
<td><img src="mafe_distro.gif"></td></tr>
<tr>
<td align="middle"><i>Alias unit (upper).</i></td>
<td align="middle"><i>Distribution unit (lower).</i></td>
</tr></table>
<ol>
<LI><b>List Box</b>: This box will display all the aliases/distributions defined in
the alias file.  Clicking a particular alias/distribution in this box
will list all of the associated addresses in the
list box on the right hand side (see <A HREF="#RS">below</A>).
<li><b>Entry Box</b>: Any changes to be made to an alias or
distribution is to be put into the entry box.
<li><b>Buttons</b>:
<ol>
<li><B>Comp</b>:  If a particular item in the list box is selected and
the <B>Comp</B> button is pressed, <tt>mafe</tt> launches a compose
sedit window from within <tt>exmh</tt>.  The <tt>To:</tt> field
will be filled in with the List Box's selection.
<li><B>Insert</B>: Inserts whatever is in the Entry Box (if not empty)
into the List Box and generates a new alias/distribution.  Any
addresses to be added will be done on the right hand frame (see
<A HREF="#RS">below</A>).
<li><B>Change</B>: If an entry is selected in the List Box and the
Entry Box is not empty, the two values will be swapped.
<li><B>Delete</B>: Delete the selection in the List Box.
<li><B>Alias</B> or <B>Distro</B>: If the selection is a distribution,
it (and its addresses) will be moved to the Alias unit.  Similarly for
aliases.  However, distributions require an addition distribution tag
(see <A HREF="#intro">Introduction</A>) and the default value of
"<tt>Undisclosed Recipients</tt>" will be used.  This value can be changed
in the right hand frame (see <A HREF="#RS">below</A>).
</ol>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<A NAME="RS"><U><B>Right Side Frame</B></U>: In this frame, changes
can be made to the addresses belonging to the selected
alias/distribution.<br>
<img src="mafe_addr.gif"><br>
<ol>
<LI><b>Distro. Tag Entry Box</b>:  This box remains inactive if an
alias is selected.  If a distribution is selected, this box becomes
active and displays the distribution's tag.
<LI><b>Set Button</b>: If the user changes the distribution's tag (in
the Entry Box), this button will become active.  Click to permanently
change the distribution's tag.
<LI><b>List Box</b>: Once an alias/distribution is selected on the
left side, its addresses will be displayed in this box.
<li><b>Entry Box</b>: Any changes to be made to an address is to be put into the entry box.
<li><b>Buttons</b>:
<ol>
<li><B>Insert</B>: Adds whatever is in the Entry Box (if not empty)
to the list of addresses in the List Box.
<li><B>Change</B>: If an entry is selected in the List Box and the
Entry Box is not empty, the two values will be swapped.
<li><B>Delete</B>: Delete the selection in the List Box.
<li><B>Expand</B>: If a particular address is selected and it is an
alias/distribution, clicking Expand will substitute the address with
the addresses found in the corresponding alias/distribution.  If no
item is selected in the list box, Expand will perform a similar operation on all
addresses in the list box which are aliases/distributions.  Note,
Expand only expands alias/distribution which are defined in
the current alias file being edited.  For example if an alias contains
the alias "john", "john" will only be expanded if it is defined in the
current file.  
<li><B>Contract</B>: This is nearly the opposite of Expand.  Like
Expand, it will operate only on one address if it is selected,
otherwise it will operate on all addresses in the list box.  However,
Contract is careful about what it contracts.  In particular, it
operates on an address if and only if:
<ul>
<li> the email address is explicitly defined in another alias/distribution in
the current file and 
<li> this other alias/distribution in which the email address is
defined has, at most, three addresses in its definition.
</ul>
This is a bit terse, but for a good reason.  To demonstrate why,
consider the following alias file:<br>
<tt>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
ProjectList:</td><td nowrap> jordan1@home.ca, jordan2@work.ca, tracy@foo.bar</td></tr><tr>
<td>
Jordan: </td><td nowrap>jordan1@home.ca, jordan2@work.ca, jordan3@laptop.com</TD></TR><TR>
<td>
DistroList:</td><td nowrap>   tracy@foo.bar, hans@down.de, einstein@hair.com, \</TD></TR><TR>
<td></td><td nowrap> fred@rick.com, apple@day.ca, ... , person100@years.old
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</tt>
Now, suppose the <tt>ProjectList</tt> alias was selected and the
Contract button pressed.  If there were not a three-address limit, the
alias would then read<br>
<tt><table><tr><td nowrap>
ProjectList: Jordan, DistroList
</td></</td></tr></table></tt>
and so <i>all</i> of <tt>DistroList</tt> is included in
<tt>ProjectList</tt> and not just <tt>tracy@foo.bar</tt>.  This may
not be desirable. With the three-address limit, the line would become
<tt><table><tr><td nowrap>
ProjectList: Jordan, tracy@foo.bar
</td></</td></tr></table></tt>
(note, that <tt>Jordan</tt> contains one more email address than what
was in the original <tt>ProjectList</tt>.  This might be ok if all the
addresses in <tt>Jordan</tt> belongs to the same person).

 Really, Contract is meant to replace
several email addresses in an alias/distribution which belong to one
person only and replace these addresses with an alias or distribution
name for brevity.  So use with caution.<br><br>
If the number 3 is unsatisfactory (i.e., you want the limit to be 2
addresses or 8, etc.), change the line <tt>$UpperLimit=3;</tt>.

<A NAME="issues"><H2>Issues</H2>

<p>The following lists a few issues with <tt>mafe</tt>
<ol>
<li> When saving an alias file, <tt>mafe</tt> first saves the
distributions in alphabetical order and then the aliases in
alphabetical order.  It just looks nice to read.  However, it does
potentially pose a problem since an alias may then be defined before it is used
(since in <tt>nmh</tt> an alias needs to be referenced before it is
defined).  If this is the case, repeat the alias file name in
<tt>.mh_profile</tt>:<br>
<tt>
AliasFile: .mh_aliases1 .mh_aliases2  .mh_aliases1 .mh_aliases2 
</tt><br><br>
<li> <tt>mafe</tt> was written in Perl with the Tk module.  It would
have been nice to have written it in Tcl+Tk, so that it would be more
native to the exmh package.  Perhaps one day I'll sit down and learn
Tcl and do this.  Anyone up for the challenge of porting is more than welcome.
